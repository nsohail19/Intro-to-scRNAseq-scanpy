    "This repository has teaching materials for a hands-on **Introduction to single-cell RNA-seq** workshop. This workshop will instruct participants on how to design a single-cell RNA-seq experiment, and how to efficiently manage and analyze the data starting from count matrices. This will be a hands-on workshop in which we will focus on using the Scanpy package using Python/Jupyter Lab.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Describe best practices for designing a single-cell RNA-seq experiment\n",
    "- Describe steps in a single-cell RNA-seq analysis workflow\n",
    "- Use Scanpy and associated tools to perform analysis of single-cell expression data, including data filtering, QC, integration, clustering, and marker identification\n",
    "- Understand practical considerations for performing scRNA-seq, rather than in-depth exploration of algorithm theory\n",
