This workshop will instruct participants on how to design a single-cell RNA-seq experiment, and how to efficiently manage and analyze the data starting from count matrices. This will be a hands-on workshop in which we will focus on using the Scanpy package using Python/Jupyter Lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are amenable to self-guided learning."
