    "\n",
    "Running cellranger requires a lot of time and computational resources in order to process a single sample. Therefore, having access to a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster is necessary to run it. Some sequencing cores will automatically process samples with cellranger and provide the outputs to you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that prior to this step, **you must have a cellranger compatible reference genome generated**. If you are working with mouse or human, 10x has pre-generated the reference which can be downloaded from their [website](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/downloads) for use. If you are using another organism, cellranger has a mode called [mkref](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/tutorials/cr-tutorial-mr) which will generate everything needed for a reference from the files you supply (GTF and fasta).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are showing an example of how to run `cellranger count` on Harvard's O2 HPC using SLURM. To run this script, you will have add additional information, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The name of the project (the results will be placed in a folder of the same name)\n",
    "* Path to the FASTQ files from your experiment\n",
    "* Path to the reference genome \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following **example script**, you would just have to change the variable specified in the [\"Inputs for cellranger\" section](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/analysis/inputs/cr-inputs-overview) on eth 10x support site. We have already provided some optimal parameters in terms of runtime and memory for running `cellranger count`.\n",
