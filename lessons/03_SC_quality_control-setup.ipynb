In this paper, the authors present a computational algorithm that harnesses genetic variation (eQTL) to determine the genetic identity of each droplet containing a single cell (singlet) and identify droplets containing two cells from different individuals (doublets).\n",

    "This dataset is available on GEO ([GSE96583](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE96583)), however the available counts matrix lacked mitochondrial reads, so we downloaded the BAM files from the SRA ([SRP102802](https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/sra?term=SRP102802)). These BAM files were converted back to FASTQ files, then run through [Cell Ranger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger) to obtain the count data that we will be using.\n",

    "Some relevant metadata for our dataset is provided below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The libraries were prepared using 10X Genomics version 2 chemistry\n",
    "* The samples were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500\n",
    "* PBMC samples from eight individual lupus patients were separated into two aliquots each. \n",
    "  * One aliquot of PBMCs was activated by 100 U/mL of recombinant IFN-β for 6 hours. \n",
    "  * The second aliquot was left untreated. \n",
    "  * After 6 hours, the eight samples for each condition were pooled together in two final pools (stimulated cells and control cells). We will be working with these two, pooled samples. (*We did not demultiplex the samples because SNP genotype information was used to demultiplex in the paper and the barcodes/sample IDs were not readily available for this data. Generally, you would demultiplex and perform QC on each individual sample rather than pooling the samples.*)\n",
    "* 12,138 and 12,167 cells were identified (after removing doublets) for control and stimulated pooled samples, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since the samples are PBMCs, we will expect immune cells, such as:\n",
    "  * B cells\n",
    "  * T cells\n",
    "  * NK cells\n",
    "  * monocytes\n",
    "  * macrophages\n",
    "  * possibly megakaryocytes\n",
    "  \n",
    "**It is recommended that you have some expectation regarding the cell types you expect to see in a dataset prior to performing the QC.** This will inform you if you have any cell types with low complexity (lots of transcripts from a few genes) or cells with higher levels of mitochondrial expression. This will enable us to account for these biological factors during the analysis workflow.\n",

For example, if you expect a particular cell type in your dataset to be smaller and/or not as transcriptionally active as other cell types in your dataset, these cells have the potential to be filtered out.
